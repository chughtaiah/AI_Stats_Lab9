# Question 1: Confusion Matrix, Metrics, and Threshold Effects
# ============================================================

def confusion_matrix_counts(y_true, y_pred):
    """
    Compute confusion matrix counts for binary classification.

    Parameters:
        y_true : true labels, values must be 0 or 1
        y_pred : predicted labels, values must be 0 or 1

    Returns:
        (TP, FP, FN, TN)

    Definitions:
        TP = actual positive and predicted positive
        FP = actual negative but predicted positive
        FN = actual positive but predicted negative
        TN = actual negative and predicted negative

    Hints:
        - Compare y_true and y_pred element by element.
        - You may use a loop or NumPy boolean masks.
        - Return the values in this exact order:
              (TP, FP, FN, TN)
    """

def classification_metrics(y_true, y_pred):
    """
    Compute classification metrics.

    Returns:
        A dictionary with keys:
            "recall"
            "fallout"
            "precision"
            "accuracy"

    Formulas:
        recall    = TP / (TP + FN)
        fallout   = FP / (FP + TN)
        precision = TP / (TP + FP)
        accuracy  = (TP + TN) / (TP + FP + FN + TN)

    If a denominator is zero, return 0.0 for that metric.

    Hints:
        - First call confusion_matrix_counts.
        - Then compute each metric from TP, FP, FN, and TN.
        - Return a dictionary, not a tuple or list.
    """

def apply_threshold(scores, threshold):
    """
    Convert prediction scores into binary predictions.

    Parameters:
        scores    : predicted probabilities or scores
        threshold : decision threshold

    Returns:
        NumPy array:
            1 if score >= threshold
            0 otherwise

    Hints:
        - Convert scores to a NumPy array if needed.
        - Use the rule:
              score >= threshold  -> 1
              score < threshold   -> 0
    """

def threshold_metrics_analysis(y_true, scores, thresholds):
    """
    Analyze how changing threshold affects recall and fallout.

    Parameters:
        y_true     : true binary labels
        scores     : predicted probabilities or scores
        thresholds : list or array of threshold values

    Returns:
        A list of dictionaries, one per threshold:

        [
            {
                "threshold": threshold,

                "accuracy": accuracy
            },
            ...
        ]

    Hints:
        - For each threshold:
            1. Convert scores to predictions using apply_threshold.
            2. Compute classification_metrics.
            3. Store the threshold and metrics in a dictionary.

    Important idea:
        Lower threshold usually predicts more positives.
        This usually increases recall but may also increase fallout.

        Higher threshold usually predicts fewer positives.
        This usually decreases fallout but may also decrease recall.
